Automotive Door Locked System using ARM microcontroller (stm32).
Two microcontrollers connected via UART, the first microcontroller (ECU1) is connected to door
sensor, DC motor and LCD, the second microcontroller (ECU2) is connected to light and buzzer.
ECU2 checks the state of door sensor and DC motor then it decides whether to turn on the buzzer
or not.
